# Right-Click Deployment - Advanced Labor Validation System

## ✅ **Latest Enhancement: Employee Constraint & Future Labor Validation**

**Latest Deployment:** August 1, 2025 @ 10:15 UTC  
**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFUL** - Advanced labor validation system deployed

### 🏢 **New Critical Validations Added:**

#### **1. Employee Count Constraint Validation** ✅ NEW

- **Feature**: Hourly employee counts can never exceed total clocked-in employees
- **Implementation**: Fetches real-time clocked-in employee count from "Who's Clocked In" API
- **Validation**: Caps hourly `employeesWorking` to maximum of currently clocked-in employees
- **Auto-Correction**: Proportionally reduces labor hours and costs when capping employee counts
- **Impact**: Ensures data integrity between clocked-in dashboard and labor dashboard

#### **2. Future Labor Hours Prohibition** ✅ NEW

- **Rule**: ZERO labor hours allowed for any future time periods
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive validation that future hours must have no labor activity
- **Detection**: Identifies and blocks labor hours, costs, and employee counts for future times
- **Auto-Correction**: Forces all future labor data to zero immediately
- **Impact**: Eliminates impossible scenarios where labor exists in the future

### 🔧 **Enhanced Data Quality Features:**

#### **Previous Hour 24 Validation** ✅ MAINTAINED

- Converts invalid hour 24 to hour 0 (midnight)
- Prevents data processing errors for overnight shifts

#### **Labor Percentage Analysis** ✅ ENHANCED

- Accounts for salaried employees not included in labor cost calculations
- Provides contextual recommendations based on restaurant industry standards

#### **Sales-Labor Alignment** ✅ IMPROVED

- Operating hours context (11:00-22:00) for better validation accuracy
- Reduces false positives during off-hours delivery/takeout periods

### 📊 **Validation Categories Updated:**

1. **Future Data Blocking** - Now explicitly prohibits future labor hours
2. **Sales Validation** - Order values and consistency checks
3. **Labor Validation** - Wage ranges and hour distributions
4. **Alignment Validation** - Sales-labor coverage gap detection
5. **Business Logic Validation** - Restaurant industry standards
6. **Employee Constraint Validation** ✅ NEW - Clocked-in employee limits

#### **2. Sales Data Validation** ✅ ENABLED

- Validates order values (negative orders, unusually high orders)
- Future sales order detection and blocking
- Guest average calculation verification
- Order consistency checks

#### **3. Labor Data Validation** ✅ ENABLED

- Enhanced wage validation (restaurant industry ranges)
- Future hour filtering with multiple safety checks
- Employee hours distribution validation
- Labor cost consistency checks
- Negative value protection

#### **4. Sales-Labor Alignment Validation** ✅ ENABLED
